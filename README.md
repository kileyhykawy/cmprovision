# CM4 provisioning system #

Web application to mass program Compute Module 4 devices.


## Usage ##

Using the web application as an end user.

Make sure eth0 connects to an Ethernet switch that only has the CMIO 4 boards connected. **Do NOT connect eth0 to your office/public network, or it may provision other Pi devices in your network as well.** You can use the wifi interface to connect to your local network.

1. Start with a fresh Raspberry Pi OS (Lite) installation.  For simplicity, use Raspberry Pi Imager and the advanced settings menu (Ctrl-Shift-X) to set the password, hostname and wifi.

    **NOTE:** If you intend to write images larger than 2 GB, you need to install the **64-bit** edition of Raspberry Pi OS, available at https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_arm64/images/.

1. Configure eth0 to have a static IP of 172.20.0.1 inside a /16 subnet (netmask 255.255.0.0):

    ```
    sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
    ```

    Add to bottom of file:

    ```
    interface eth0
    static ip_address=172.20.0.1/16
    ```

    Do not set a default gateway. Reboot afterwards.

1. Run `sudo apt update` to make sure your repository is up-to-date, and it is able to install dependencies.

1. Install the ready-made .deb package from https://github.com/raspberrypi/cmprovision/releases/:

    ```
    sudo apt install ./cmprovision4_*_all.deb
    ```

1. Set a web application username and password with:

    ```
    sudo /var/lib/cmprovision/artisan auth:create-user
    ```

You can now access the web interface with a web browser on the wifi IP.


## Development ##

This PHP web application uses the Laravel framework.
Make sure you familarize yourself with the fine documentation: https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/.

In particular note:
* run `composer --install` to install the dependencies living in the `vendor` directory.
* you probably also want to `npm install` to be able to rebuild resources.
* if you want to use Tailwind css styles not already used in the application run: `npm run prod` after adding the html to have the .css file rebuild with the used styles included. (alternatively can run `npm run dev` to include all styles. But will result in a large .css file, so only use that during development).
* if you modify .blade files make sure you regenerate the cache with: `./artisan view:cache`.

## Build Debian package ##

Steps:
1. Ensure `debuild` is installed- Install `devscripts` package from `apt`
2.  From the root of the project folder, run `debuild`

Output .deb package goes to parent folder of root project folder.

## Licence ##

The main code of the CM4 provisioning system is made available under the terms of the BSD 3-clause ("new") license.
Look in the `vendor` directory (after running `composer --install`) to consult the open source licenses of the various dependencies like the Laravel framework used.
